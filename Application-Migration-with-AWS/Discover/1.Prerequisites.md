## Verify your ADS Credential

In order to deploy the ADS Agent into our **Source-Webserver** and **Source-DBServer**, we need AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) credential with proper permissions to communicate with AWS ADS APIs. These credentials were already created as part of environment setup.

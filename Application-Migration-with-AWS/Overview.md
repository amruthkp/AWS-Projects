# Application Migration with AWS

In this project we will focus on Migrate & Modernize phase, we will learn how to migrate a fictional application to AWS cloud by:

- **Replatform of database with AWS Database Migration Service** - a managed migration and replication service that helps move your database and analytics workloads to AWS quickly, securely, and with minimal downtime and zero data loss.

- **Rehost of application with AWS Application Migration Service** - Application Migration Service simplifies, expedites, and reduces the cost of migrating and modernizing applications.

- **Replatform of application to containers running on Amazon Elastic Container Service** - Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a fully managed container orchestration service. You can choose to run your ECS clusters using:

  -  AWS Fargate launch type, which provides serverless compute capabilities for containers, or
  - EC2 instances that you manage.


- **Replatform of application to a managed platform on AWS Elastic Beanstalk** - With Elastic Beanstalk you can quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud without having to learn about the infrastructure that runs those applications.
